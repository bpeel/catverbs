I think these things are mistakes in Els Verbs Conjugats:

• The imperative for ‘dar’ is shifted wrong so that the conjugation
  for nosaltres appears as the one for ells.

• The second-person plural simple future for eixir is ‘eixereu’ but
  that doesn't make sense and Viccionari and DIEC seem to have it as
  ‘eixireu’.

• The first-person plural present indicative for ‘entrelluir’ is
  listed as ‘entrelluem’ but it should probably be ‘entrelluïm’.

• ‘haguereu’ is missing an accent for the simple past of heure.

• It says that lleure is conjugated like creure. However DIEC and
  Viccionari say that is conjugated like beure. These differ in the
  imperfect. GDLC confusingly seems to say it is conjugated like seure
  (which is like creure) but actually shows a conjugatoin like beure
  in the conjugation page. I've chosen beure in catverbs.

• júnyer is listed as being like servir. Apparently it is an
  antiquated verb that in practice is only used in the infinitive now
  so the conjugation probably doesn't really matter. However
  Viccionari lists it as being like témer which probably makes more
  sense so I've chosen that for catverbs.

• For aguar, EVC has some strange diacritics which don't look right
  and don't match DIEC. Catverbs currently uses what EVC does.

This seem to be mistakes in Viccionari:

• DIEC doesn't list ‘apareixo’ and only has ‘aparec’. However a quick
  google seems to indicate that people do use the first form so I've
  left it in.

• In argüir, EVC always has the umlaut above the u, whereas viccionari
  has it changing to the i sometimes. diccionari.cat also does this
  but in different places. DIEC doesn't say anything about the
  conjugation which might imply it's regular and shouldn't move the
  umlaut. Catverbs doesn't move it.

These things would be good to add as notes to the conjugations:

• The conjugation with ‘eix’ in lluir is used when the verb used
  figuratively.

• adir has a different conjugation when used reflexively.
