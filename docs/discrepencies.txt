I think these things are mistakes in Els Verbs Conjugats:

• The imperative for ‘dar’ is shifted wrong so that the conjugation
  for nosaltres appears as the one for ells.

• The second-person plural simple future for eixir is ‘eixereu’ but
  that doesn't make sense and Viccionari and DIEC seem to have it as
  ‘eixireu’.

• The first-person plural present indicative for ‘entrelluir’ is
  listed as ‘entrelluem’ but it should probably be ‘entrelluïm’.

These things would be good to add as notes to the conjugations:

• The conjugation with ‘eix’ in lluir is used when the verb used
  figuratively.
